# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview:

The goal of this project was from the perspective of a Human Resources Analyst for Pewlett Hackard to determine how many current employees will be retiring over the next few years and which departments these retiring employees work in so the organization can plan accordingly. In addition, the company is seeking to identify PH staff who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to train new employees. This task was completed using a SQL database, creating entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), and the import and export of csv datasets. 

## Results:

### Number of Retiring Employees by Title: 

  •	A total of 90,398 are expected to retire in the next few years.
  
  •	63.8% of employees that will be retiring soon hold senior level positions.
  
  •	48.3% of those expected to retire soon are Engineers.

## Summary:

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 

•	90,398 roles are in urgent need to be filled out as soon as the workforce starts retiring.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? 

•	As there are only 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program, it appears there may be a shortfall in meeting demand since not enough qualified retiring employees will be available to mentor the next generation that will fill the vacated roles. With the large number of retiring employees, each mentor would need to mentor approximately 58 employees, which is an unreasonable number for each mentor.
